Welcome to GolfLand! Pull back on the ball, aim, and shoot. Complete the hole in as few strokes as possible and complete as many holes as you can. If you receive 3 more than par on a hole, you lose! Beware of the water hazards, as if you go into them you get a penalty stroke and are randomly popped out. Also beware of the bunkers which are harder to hit out of. Press the 'h' key if you need a hint, and the shortest path to the hole is drawn for you. Every three holes, the game gets harder as the number of obstacles increases and the board gets bigger. Make sure you enter the hole at the right speed, if the ball is going too fast it won't go in. Enjoy your time in Golfland!
